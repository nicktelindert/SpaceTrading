# SpaceTrading
A game where you buy and sell products while competing against an other AI players. 
I do this project mostly to improve my coding and organization abilities.

## Goals
- Do a project completely TDD
- Try to get better at working organized and structured

## Done
- product lists can be randomly generated and added to a planets market
- a marketvalue can be calculated based on product name
- planets can be generated
- AI players can be generated
- a new "Game" can be created with all the necessary entities
- Everything is fully unit tested with JEST(>90%)
- CLI Basic game(In progress)
- Buying mechanism
- Player stats are visible
- Selling product on a planet
- complete game implementation in CLI 
- Add min-max range for market numbers
- Move functions between classes so they make more sense  
- Add more non happy-flow tests
- Re-add to market when selling back
- Generate new markets every round

## Todo
- implement basic AI player behaviour
