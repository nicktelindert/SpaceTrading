A game where you buy and sell products while competing against an other AI players. 
I do this project mostly to improve my coding and organization abilities.

## Goals

## Done
- product lists can be randomly generated and added to a planets market
- a marketvalue can be calculated based on product name
- planets can be generated
- AI players can be generated
- a new "Game" can be created with all the necessary entities
- Everything is fully unit tested with JEST(Mostly)
- CLI Basic game(In progress)
- Buying mechanism
- Player stats are visible
- Basic game mechanism(Not completely implementen in CLI yet)

## Todo
