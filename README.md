# SpaceTrading
A game where you buy and sell products while competing against an other AI players. 
I do this project mostly to improve my coding and organization abilities.

## Goals

- Try to get better at working organized and structured

## Done
- product lists can be randomly generated and added to a planets market
- a marketvalue can be calculated based on product name
- planets can be generated
- AI players can be generated
- a new "Game" can be created with all the necessary entities
- Everything is fully unit tested with JES


## Todo
- Add a buy and selling mechanism
- Add a rounds mechanism
- Add function to return players stats
- Add a cli based version to test generic gameplay
- Add a vue3 frontend to interact with the game
