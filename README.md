# SpaceTrading
A game where you buy and sell products while competing against an other AI players. 
I do this project mostly to improve my coding and organization abilities.

## Goals
- Do a project completely TDD
- Try to get better at working organized and structured

## Todo
- Implement Winner flow
- Implement Game-over flow
- Base market price on current market supply (Is now a random number)

### Future ideas
- Add scenario mechanism
- Add space sounds
- Planet profiles 
- Animations

## Credits

- HEX: #8ca3a3
- HEX: #484f4f

### Frontend
- Build using vue3/vite

### Game logic
- Build using javascript
- Tested using JEST


### Notes
The writting tests are Integration tests which test the complete game logic and should not really be considered Unit Tests.
I will need to do some research how to mock my current code so i can do decent unit testing.
